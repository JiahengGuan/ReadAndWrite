# ReadAndWrite
About this project, I designed a program that after we compile it, it will take two command line arguments which are the input source filename and also the output target filename. Inside this program, it will read the source file contents in the parent process and write the contents to a pipe (usually we will just write it to the output target file, but here we want to practice with pipe). Then in the child process, it will read the contents from the pipe write the contents to the output file and finally print the contents out in the screen. That's the program basically do.

When I was designing this program, first of all I thought it is not difficult at all. Because we already go though the example of the using of pipe. But when I actually doing the coding part, some problems just pop up one by one. The most important part I think is how to fully understand the cfile copying method and also combine it with the pipe part. That takes me a while to solve that, after figure that out, the program is basically completed, maybe some more details to fix or add. And also because I change a new pc before these couple weeks, so I need to download and set up the compiler for C and C++, it also took me like half hours to finished that. But hopefully just solve the problems and work the program out.
